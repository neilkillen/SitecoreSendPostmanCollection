# SitecoreSendPostmanCollection
Sitecore Send Postman Collection

Iâ€™ve created this postman collection by converting the Sitecore Send (Moosend) API Blueprint specification to Open API for use within Postman. Details of the conversion process can be found here https://neilkillen.com/2021/12/16/creating-a-postman-collection-for-sitecore-send-moosend/ 

## Authentication
Authentication is achieved through the use of an API key. Before you can use the collection you need an API key for your account. The API key is included in all the requests sent to Moosend. You can obtain your API key if you head over to Moosend -> Settings -> api key.
